\caption{\textbf{Silhouette Score of UMAP Clustering for SWR\textsuperscript{+} Candidates and SWR\textsuperscript{-} Candidates}}
\smallskip
\\
The silhouette scores (mean \textpm SD across sessions per subject) for UMAP clustering of $\text{SWR}^\text{+}$ candidates and $\text{SWR}^\text{-}$ candidates are represented based on their respective multi-unit spike patterns (Figure~\ref{fig:04}A). The mean scores were 0.205, and the standard deviation was 0.285, calculated for the interquartile range (IQR; Figure~\ref{fig:04}B).
